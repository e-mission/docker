## Creating the main server

This starts the main e-mission server. Use this if you want to connect the
phone app to it, either to collect data or for e2e development.

### Testing

The server is started on port 8080. 

- So on \*nix systems, this server is at http://localhost:8080
- For other operating systems, you may have to use a different host than
  `localhost. For more details, check the instructions on connecting to the
   [created container in the main README](../../README.md#Connecting_to_the_created_container)
